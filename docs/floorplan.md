# Floorplan

Below are simplified notes on each floor of the **Nancy Rothwell Building**. Areas in **red** on the official maps are *off-limits* to Hack-A-Bot participants. Please stay within the green **authorized work spaces**, the **makerspace**, and the **designated study/collaboration areas**.

## Ground Floor

- **Main Working Area** (Authorized Work Space): This is the central hacking zone where most participants are encouraged to stay, ensuring easy access to the Makerspace and a lively atmosphere.  
- **Food Serving Area** (Top Right): Grab snacks and meals in the “meet and greet” section.  
- **Registration Desk** (South Entrance): Head here to check in or if you have questions.  
- **Spanish Steps & Rest Area**: Short “power naps” only (please use the bean bags).  
- **Challenges 1 & 2**: Their arenas will be set up in front of the Spanish Steps.  
- **Makerspace**: Open for use throughout the event. **Challenge 3** judging will take place here on the second day.

> While you may explore elsewhere, we strongly encourage participants to remain on the **Ground Floor** near the Makerspace or in the first-floor study spaces to keep the social “hackathon vibe” alive.

## First Floor

- **Balconies Overlooking Spanish Steps**: Equipped with computers and casual seating areas.  
- **Study Spaces (East Side)**: Additional spots to collaborate, still close enough to maintain the event energy.  
- **Lecture Theatre A**: Host to main presentations, workshops, and announcements.

## Second Floor

- **More Computers Near Balconies**: Ideal if you need a quieter space or a different view.  
- **Extra Working Areas (East Side)**: Additional tables and power outlets for your hacking needs.

## Grouping Together

We recommend **grouping up** if you decide to head above Ground Floor. Splitting across too many floors can dilute the hackathon atmosphere. Staying near the Makerspace or in the first-floor study spaces ensures you’re never far from your teammates, resources, or the event action!

**Enjoy exploring the Nancy Rothwell Building, but remember: the red areas on the map are off-limits and the best hackathon vibes are where your fellow participants are.**
