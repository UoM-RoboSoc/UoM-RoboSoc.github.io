## Introduction

Hack-A-Bot is run by students, for students — with help from a lot of robots, arduinos and Raspberry Pis.

The event is organised by the UoM Robotics Society Events Team, with key leads being:

## Technical Info

We’re based in the **Nancy Rothwell Building** (previously known as the Engineering Building or MECD) — please stick to the designated floors during the hackathon.

- **Makerspace** (Ground Floor): For collecting components and materials.  
  {: .warning }
 > Check the inventory list before asking technicians for help.
- Power outlets and workspaces are located on the 1st and 2nd floors.
- Refreshments and chill-out zones are available in the **Meet and Greet Space on the Ground Floor** next to the vending machines.

There’ll be mini-events like the **Robot Fighting League** throughout the weekend — keep an eye on the Announcements tab and our Instagram for when they pop up!

## Supervisor Support

Throughout the event, supervisors will be around to help out and keep things running smoothly. Here's how they can support you and what you should know:

#### Who Are They?

Supervisors will be clearly identifiable by their green shirts and are here to help! If you’re unsure about anything, feel free to ask them.

If something more serious comes up, speak to **Izzy, Thierry, Ted, or Archie** — they'll be around throughout the event.

#### Where You’ll See Supervisors

- **Roaming Supervisors** (Ground, First & Second Floors)  
  - Available to answer questions and provide directions.
  - Will redirect anyone sleeping to the rest area near **Makerspace and the Spanish Steps**.

- **Makerspace Supervisors**  
  - **Inventory Desk:** They’ll manage distribution of parts and components. Be ready to explain your project before collecting materials.  
  - **Roaming Support:** Enforcing safety rules, offering assistance, and keeping the space safe and calm.  
  - **3D Printing:** Helping you set up and run 3D prints safely and effectively.

#### Quick Reminders

- **Be respectful and patient** with supervisors — they’re students just like you, giving up their weekend to make this event possible.
- **Follow instructions** in the Makerspace and respect decisions around safety and equipment use.
- If you’re asked to take a break or move due to safety or capacity reasons, please cooperate.

If in doubt, **just ask** — we're here to help.

## Safety Guidelines

All participants **must** complete the Makerspace safety induction before using the Makerspace:

[Makerspace Induction](https://online.manchester.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_14584806_1&course_id=_75608_1&mode=reset)

1. Log in with your Manchester account.  
2. Click on **Makerspace Local Induction**.  
3. Complete the induction course, then score **100%** on the quiz.

## Floor Plan

We've worked closely with **TEAMs** to ensure we’ve secured as much space as possible across the Nancy Rothwell Building for Hack-A-Bot. Please respect the designated areas — they’ve been carefully planned for your use throughout the event.

Anyone found using restricted areas without explicit permission will be asked to leave those spaces. Second offences will not be tolerated.

The Engineering Building is an incredible facility, and we want to make sure future RoboSoc members (and students in general) can continue hosting exciting events here.

## Sleeping Arrangements

Please note that **prolonged sleeping anywhere in the building is strictly disallowed**. We do, however, have a **dedicated rest area** near the Spanish Steps on the ground floor, equipped with bean bags for short “power naps.” If anyone is found sleeping elsewhere, we’ll have to wake you and suggest heading home if you need a more substantial rest, then returning fresh in the morning.

Thanks for understanding our need to maintain a safe, productive environment. And if you really need a boost—maybe a **Red Bull** will do the trick!

## Merch

You should’ve received your official Hack-A-Bot merch at registration.  
Didn’t get any? Want more? Speak to a supervisor and we’ll sort you out.
