## Supervisor Support

Throughout the event, supervisors will be around to help out and keep things running smoothly. Here's how they can support you and what you should know:

#### Who Are They?

Supervisors will be clearly identifiable by their green shirts and are here to help! If youâ€™re unsure about anything, feel free to ask them.

If something more serious comes up, speak to **Izzy, Thierry, Ted, or Archie** â€” they'll be around throughout the event.

#### Where Youâ€™ll See Supervisors

- **Roaming Supervisors** (Ground, First & Second Floors)  
  - Available to answer questions and provide directions.
  - Will redirect anyone sleeping to the rest area near **Makerspace and the Spanish Steps**.

- **Makerspace Supervisors**  
  - **Inventory Desk:** Theyâ€™ll manage distribution of parts and components. Be ready to explain your project before collecting materials.  
  - **Roaming Support:** Enforcing safety rules, offering assistance, and keeping the space safe and calm.  
  - **3D Printing:** Helping you set up and run 3D prints safely and effectively.

#### Quick Reminders

- **Be respectful and patient** with supervisors â€” theyâ€™re students just like you, giving up their weekend to make this event possible.
- **Follow instructions** in the Makerspace and respect decisions around safety and equipment use.
- If youâ€™re asked to take a break or move due to safety or capacity reasons, please cooperate.

If in doubt, **just ask** â€” we're here to help.
