# Task 3 - Sony Raspberry Pi AI Camera

The University is busy with many moving parts. Your goal is to create an innovative solution using a **Raspberry Pi AI Camera** (provided) to assist with tasks like tracking sports teams‚Äô positions and energy levels, or ensuring people in the Makerspace wear the correct safety gear. 

That said ‚Äî your project **doesn‚Äôt have to be university-related**. You‚Äôre free to explore any application area you find interesting, whether it‚Äôs environmental monitoring, accessibility tools, retail automation, or something completely out of the box. Just remember: your project will be judged by **industry professionals**, so make it smart, purposeful, and impactful.

**Ideas & Inspiration**

- **Use on-board AI processing** to detect certain patterns or identify whether someone is wearing protective equipment.  
- **Build a real-time monitoring system** to track and log data (e.g., athlete stats, lab safety compliance, etc.).  
- **Combine sensor inputs** for advanced event detection (e.g., accidents, missing gear).

**Challenge Focus**

- **Real-World Impact:** Show how AI can solve actual campus or global problems.  
- **Robust Recognition:** Demonstrate strong image recognition or object detection.  
- **IoT & Robotics Integration:** Potential synergy with other robotic or IoT systems.

Sony is offering a dedicated talk to explain the system in detail. In this lecture at 12:00 on the First Day, delivered by Sony Raspberry Pi AI representative **Stijn Woestenborghs**, you‚Äôll get live examples, use cases, and insights into how to leverage the camera for innovative applications.

Every single person doing this challenge should go this lecture, it'll give you all sorts of ideas and you are free to ask questions.

Note that while we‚Äôre providing these resources and examples, there is little initial guidance‚Äîdetails on judging and awards will be given later on in the day.

# Initial Setup & Network Configuration

Before you start developing your application, it's essential to perform the initial setup of your Raspberry Pi. Follow these steps:

#### 1. First-Time Setup (Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse)
- **Connect to Peripherals:**  
  Plug in a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to your Raspberry Pi.
- **Boot & Log In:**  
  Power on the Pi and log in using the default credentials.
- **Connect to the Internet:**  
  Use the monitor's graphical interface to connect to a WiFi hotspot that provides internet access (your phones maybe). This connection is critical to update, upgrade, install, and download necessary packages.
- **Go through the setup of your raspberry pi and go through some examples**
- **Alternative Connection:**  
  If you prefer, you can connect the Pi to your personal WiFi hotspot (via your smartphone or portable router) to download packages.

#### 2. Transitioning to Wireless Operation
Once your Pi is fully configured and updated, you can enable SSH to operate headlessly:
- **Enable SSH:**  
- **Come down to the Sony section and use the Dedicated Access Point**  
  
#### 3. Example Setup Guides

## Connectivity & Programming Options

There are three main ways you can connect to and program your Raspberry Pi:

### 1. Dedicated Wireless Access Point
- **Method:** Connect your laptop to a dedicated wireless access point using VNC and SSH.
- **Note:** This option guarantees local network communication for local web servers. However, if the access point isn‚Äôt connected to the University‚Äôs wired network, you won‚Äôt have internet access.
- **Alternative:** If you don‚Äôt want to use wires, you can connect to one of the wireless access points located underneath the Spanish Steps on the Ground Floor.

    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;"><em>Access points under the Spanish Steps</em></p>
  </div>

### 2. Ethernet Cables and Adaptors
- **Method:** Use ethernet cables and adaptors for a direct point-to-point connection. You can interface with your Raspberry Pi using VNC and SSH.
- **Note:** We have a limited number of ethernet adaptors. There is a borrowing system in place‚Äîif you don‚Äôt have one, you may need to ask other teams to share. **Do not remove these items from the event; they are Robosoc property.**

    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;"><em>Ethernet cables and adaptors (Limited supply)</em></p>
  </div>

- **Additional Peripherals:** We also provide a couple of HDMI cables. These are available on a first-come, first-serve basis.

### 3. Makerspace Desktop Computers
- **Method:** As a last resort, you may use the display, keyboards, and mice from the desktop computers in the Makerspace.
- **Note:** This method is **not recommended** due to limited availability and the risk of disrupting the setup. If you do use these peripherals, please return everything exactly as you found it.

**Extra Credit**

You‚Äôll earn **bonus points** for creative use of the AI camera **in combination** with any of our specialized components from the hackathon inventory. Think beyond just image capture; integrate sensors, mechanical elements, or additional microcontrollers to create a truly innovative solution.

**Use Case Sharing**

Instead of distributing a traditional feedback form, we‚Äôre building the **sharing** requirement directly into the challenge. Each team must **post their use case** on a designated platform (we‚Äôre considering the official [Raspberry Pi Forum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/) but are open to suggestions) to showcase what you‚Äôve built to the broader community.

To encourage active promotion, we‚Äôre introducing a **‚ÄúCommunity Winners‚Äù** category. **One month** after the hackathon ends, we‚Äôll check which projects get the highest visibility (e.g., most views or shares). The top **two teams** will each receive an **additional prize**. 

This approach helps us amplify your creative work, fosters knowledge-sharing, and underscores our priority: getting your projects seen and discussed by a wider audience. So, once you‚Äôve finished building, **spread the word**‚Äîand good luck!
