# Task 3 - Sony Raspberry Pi AI Camera

Sony is offering a dedicated talk to explain the system in detail. In this lecture at 12:00 on the First Day, delivered by Sony Raspberry Pi AI representative **Stijn Woestenborghs**, you‚Äôll get live examples, use cases, and insights into how to leverage the camera for innovative applications.

Every single person doing this challenge should go this lecture, it'll give you all sorts of ideas and you are free to ask questions.

Note that while we‚Äôre providing these resources and examples, there is little initial guidance‚Äîdetails on judging and awards will be given later on in the day.

**Extra Credit**

You‚Äôll earn **bonus points** for creative use of the AI camera **in combination** with any of our specialized components from the hackathon inventory. Think beyond just image capture; integrate sensors, mechanical elements, or additional microcontrollers to create a truly innovative solution.

**Use Case Sharing**

Instead of distributing a traditional feedback form, we‚Äôre building the **sharing** requirement directly into the challenge. Each team must **post their use case** on a designated platform (we‚Äôre considering the official [Raspberry Pi Forum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/) but are open to suggestions) to showcase what you‚Äôve built to the broader community.

To encourage active promotion, we‚Äôre introducing a **‚ÄúCommunity Winners‚Äù** category. **One month** after the hackathon ends, we‚Äôll check which projects get the highest visibility (e.g., most views or shares). The top **two teams** will each receive an **additional prize**. 

This approach helps us amplify your creative work, fosters knowledge-sharing, and underscores our priority: getting your projects seen and discussed by a wider audience. So, once you‚Äôve finished building, **spread the word**‚Äîand good luck!
