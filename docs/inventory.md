# Inventory

We are providing **two separate inventory lists** at the start of the event:

- **General Inventory:** This list contains standard parts available to all teams throughout the hackathon.
- **Task 3 Inventory:** This specialized inventory is reserved exclusively for Task 3 teams for the first 4 hours of the event. After that time, it will be accessible to everyone.

Students will have continuous access to the general inventory during the event. To request a part, simply walk up to the inventory area on the far side of the Makerspace, provide your **student team name**, and tell the technician which part you need and from which inventory. **Please note:** Technicians have been instructed to ask what the part will be used for, so come prepared with a brief explanation of your intended use.

### Example Q&A

**Q: "What will you use this part for?"**

**Answer 1:** "I need this sensor for my robotâ€™s line-following system to improve accuracy."  
**Answer 2:** "We're using this component to build a custom mount for our camera module in Task 3."

**Note:** Access to the **Task 3 Inventory** is restricted to Task 3 teams for the first 4 hours of the event. After this period, the Task 3 inventory will be available to all participants. The same procedure applies for requesting parts from both inventories.

## Makerspace Inventory

While we do not have a **dedicated, itemised inventory list** for the Makerspace, there are a number of materials, tools, and components available that may be helpful for your project.

These can include:

- Screws, bolts, and fasteners  
- Hand tools (screwdrivers, pliers, wire strippers, etc.)  
- Soldering stations and consumables  
- Tapes, adhesives, zip ties  
- Structural prototyping materials (foam board, acrylic scraps, etc.)

We will provide **photos** of some of the most commonly requested items on this page during the event to give you an idea of whatâ€™s available.

To request access to Makerspace equipment or materials:
- Visit a **Makerspace technician** (located inside the main Makerspace area).
- Let them know what youâ€™re looking for and why you need it.
- Be clear and safe â€” some tools require supervision or safety approval.

If you're unsure whether something is available, **just ask!** The technicians are here to help.
